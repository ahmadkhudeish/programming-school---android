# Programming School Android App

People use smart phones and mobile apps every day to achieve different tasks, this presents a great platform for engagement that can be taken advantage of to enhance learning. Yet, there is a lack of mobile learning apps that embody principles of usability and learning. Most of the mobile apps for learning online offer limited interaction and user input. This often makes learning programming through mobile apps a boring and ineffective task or people just simply do not take this form of learning seriously.

I present a proof of concept of a mobile app that acts as a learning tool to enhance the learning of programming languages. The mobile app is based on a research I conducted on the principles of usability and learning. My findings suggest that the choice of colors of the app, the use of appropriate feedback, and the frequent assessment of the learning outcome are some of
the principles that could have major impact on learning. These principles could potentially enhance the learning of programming
through mobile apps and make learning through a mobile app more engaging to users.

## Running the App

You will need to have Android Studio installed on your machine and you can run it from an emulator, otherwise you can plug your mobile phone in developer mode and install it from there
